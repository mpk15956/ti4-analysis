# TI4 Map Optimization: Academic Benchmarking Approach

## Overview

This repository implements a rigorous academic framework for comparing multi-objective optimization algorithms on hexagonal game map generation.

**NO GAMEPLAY VALIDATION** - This is a pure computational experiment comparing optimization algorithms.

## Research Questions

1. **RQ1**: Does NSGA-II converge faster than hill-climbing?
2. **RQ2**: Does NSGA-II produce superior Pareto fronts?
3. **RQ3**: Does unconstrained action space (red tile swapping) expand the Pareto front?
4. **RQ4**: What trade-offs exist between balance gap and spatial distribution?
5. **RQ5**: Which algorithm is most computationally efficient?

## Six Algorithms

| ID | Algorithm | Type | Objective |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| `rs` | Random Search | Null baseline | Scalar composite (5:5:3) |
| `hc` | Greedy Hill-Climbing | Local search (no escape) | Scalar composite (5:5:3) |
| `sa` | Simulated Annealing | Markov chain, single-trajectory | Scalar composite (5:5:3) |
| `sga` | Single-Objective GA | Population-based, scalar tournament | Scalar composite (5:5:3) |
| `nsga2` | NSGA-II | Population-based, Pareto | 3-objective: (1−JFI, \|I\|, LSAP) |
| `ts` | Tabu Search | Deterministic memory, full-neighbourhood | Scalar composite (5:5:3) |

> **Naming note:** The production benchmark pipeline (`submit_all.sh`,
> `benchmark_engine.py`) uses lowercase IDs: `rs`, `hc`, `sa`, `sga`, `nsga2`, `ts`.
> SGA was added to isolate the architecture vs objective-type comparison
> (SA vs SGA = same scalar, different architecture; SGA vs NSGA-II = same
> operators, different objective). The legacy G-prefix aliases are retired.

### Objective hierarchy (Nominal Scalarization)

Given the lack of consensus on optimal weighting for composite spatial indicators (Libório et al.), we use a **5:5:3** ratio (Fairness : Clustering : Local Penalty) as a **Nominal Scalarization**. It provides a fixed target for single-objective trajectories (SA, TS, HC, SGA). Primary evaluation relies on weight-independent Pareto indicators (HV, IGD+). HV and IGD+ (Ishibuchi et al., 2015) are computed against an **empirical reference front** — the combined set of all observed non-dominated points across seeds — which is the standard approach when the true Pareto front of the problem is unknown.

## Dependent Variables (Gold-Standard Quality Indicators)

### Primary Metrics (Track B — implemented in `scripts/quality_indicators.py`)
- **Hypervolume (HV)**: Volume dominated by Pareto front (higher = better)
- **IGD+**: Inverted Generational Distance Plus (lower = better, Pareto-compliant)
- **Spacing**: Uniformity of solutions along front (lower = better)

### Secondary Metrics
- `evals_to_best`: evaluation count at which the incumbent was last improved (convergence tracking)
- Function evaluations to convergence
- Best composite score, best Jain's Index
- Pareto front cardinality (`front_size`)

### Efficiency Metrics
- Wall-clock time
- Function evaluations
- `evals_to_best` as fraction of budget (convergence efficiency)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ti4-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Academic Benchmark

Open `notebooks/08_academic_benchmark_study.ipynb` in Jupyter and execute all cells.

**Configuration options:**
- `n_trials=30` - Number of independent runs per algorithm (reduce to 3 for testing)
- `iterations=500` - Optimization iterations/generations
- `population_size=100` - NSGA-II population size

**Estimated runtime:** 1-2 hours for full 30 trials × 3 algorithms

### 3. Analyze Results

The notebook automatically:
- Runs 90 optimization trials (30 per algorithm)
- Calculates all quality indicators
- Performs statistical tests (Wilcoxon with Bonferroni correction)
- Generates publication-ready figures
- Exports LaTeX tables

**Output directory:** `results/academic_benchmark/`

- "Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction control family-wise error"
- "Effect sizes (Cohen's d, A12) quantify practical significance"
- "NSGA-II efficiently optimizes multiple spatial objectives simultaneously"

### ❌ You CANNOT claim:
- ~~"AI agents played full games"~~
- ~~"This measures actual gameplay outcomes"~~
- ~~"Win-rate variance validates experiential balance"~~
